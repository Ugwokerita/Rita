Introduction To Technology.
What is technology?


Often than non we tend to think about innovations in the communication field, we imagine visions of a smart future where everything is robotic and controlled digitally just like the science fiction movies.

We tend to take for granted, the ones we use to exchange information, to clean our clothes, to prepare our meals, and get from one place to another because the use of technology in our daily lives because it seems less impressive to us. We tend to forget even everyday items like door locks, floor panels, and furniture are technologies and not only self-driving cars, robots, and 3D printing.

Technology simply put, is the use of scientific knowledge (skills, methods and processes) to achieve a specific purpose either in a field of study, industry or in our daily lives. It is the easiest way to achieve a result.
